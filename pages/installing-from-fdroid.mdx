How to install Termux app from F-Droid:

1. Open F-Droid on your Android or Chrome OS device by clicking [this
   link](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/),
2. Click Download APK,
3. Click the downloaded APK on your device,
4. Click allow installation of apps from unknown sources (you will want
   to set this option anyway to be able to install [apps built on your
   device](working-with-apks) in Termux),
5. Allow the installation to complete,
6. Once installed, you will see the Termux launcher on your home screen
   and in your App Drawer. Click the icon to fire up the application.

Please do not mix your installation of Termux between Google Play and
F-Droid. There are compatibility issues such as, "[Can't install
Termux:Api from google play on Nougat
#53](https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/53)".
